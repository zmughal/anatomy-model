        location: superficial part of back, superiorally
        innervation: CN XI - spinal accessory nerve
        blood supply: transverse cervical artery
        action: elevation, retraction, depression, superior rotation of scapula
        insertion: acromion and spine of scapula
        fibers: descending fibers, transverse fibers, ascending fibers
